            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 mb-4">
              <li>Ensuring error-free technical presentation and optimization of the website</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">We do not use your data to draw conclusions about you personally. However, we reserve the right to check the server log files retrospectively should concrete evidence indicate illegal use.</p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2">Legal Basis and Legitimate Interest</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Processing is carried out in accordance with Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR based on our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website as well as ensuring system security and detecting abuse.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">Data is stored in server log files in a form that allows identification of data subjects for a maximum of 30 days, unless a security-relevant event occurs (e.g., a DDoS attack).</p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">In the case of such an event, server log files are stored until the security-relevant event has been eliminated and fully clarified.</p>

            <h4 className="text-lg font-medium text-gray-800 mb-2">Provision Mandatory or Required</h4>
